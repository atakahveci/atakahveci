I'm an **engineer** and **designer** who finds great motivation in creating products that help people improve their lives. For the past year, I've been involved in creating and maintaining projects with game and app publishers. I take great pride in using my engineering and design skills to craft engaging products that provide people with valuable experiences.

Prior to moving to iOS, I worked as a .NET and Web developer on a variety of projects such as serverless apps, cloud-based apps, and websites. Since I don't have the time to create the perfect READMEs, I keep my repositories private on this GitHub profile.

Currently, I manage teams, make deals with companies, and create products. In addition, I'm the founder and co-founder of two tech companies (but it feels too cheesy to mention them anywhere, so GitHub it is!). Learn more at [www.atakahveci.com/about](https://www.atakahveci.com/about).
